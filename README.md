# Building Machine Learning System to Predict the Amount of Calories Burned During Exercise
We consume calories while eating and burn them during exercise.The amount of calories burned during exercise is determined by the duration of exercise, average heart beat, body temperature, and other factors. I have a two data sets. The first data set contains information about the calories burned by the person, while the second data set contains workout information for that person.
**Objective:** Predict the number of calories burned during exercise.
**Tools and Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost.
**Data:** Utilized two datasets (Calories and Exercise) for analysis and model training.
**Methodology:**
1. Imported and combined datasets.
2. Conducted data analysis to identify key features and patterns.
3. Separated data into training and testing sets.
4. Trained multiple models, with a focus on using XGBoost for final predictions.
5. Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
**Results:** Achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.4. For instance, when the actual calories burned were 131, the predicted value was 130, indicating high accuracy.
**Impact:** The project aids fitness enthusiasts in better planning their diet and exercise routines based on predicted calorie burns, helping them maintain their fitness goals.
